    "## Kubernetes (K8s) Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Pods**\n",
    "#### **What is a Pod?**\n",
    "- A **Pod** is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.\n",
    "- It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster.\n",
    "- A Pod can contain **one or more containers**, which share the same **network namespace and storage volumes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Pods Work**\n",
    "- Containers inside a Pod communicate **via localhost**.\n",
    "- Pods are **ephemeral** (short-lived). If a Pod fails, it is replaced by a new Pod.\n",
    "- Higher-level controllers like **Deployments, StatefulSets, and ReplicaSets** manage Pods and ensure they remain available.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use Cases**\n",
    "- Running a single application or a group of tightly coupled containers (e.g., a web server and a sidecar container for logging).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Services**\n",
    "#### **What is a Service?**\n",
    "- A **Service** provides a stable network endpoint to expose a set of Pods.\n",
    "- Since Pods can restart and get new IP addresses, a Service **abstracts their dynamic IPs with a consistent endpoint**.\n",
    "- It enables communication between different parts of an application or external access.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Services Work**\n",
    "- Services use **selectors** to identify which Pods they should expose.\n",
    "- They create a virtual IP (ClusterIP) that routes traffic to the appropriate Pods.\n",
    "- Kubernetes automatically performs **load balancing** across the selected Pods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Types of Services**\n",
    "1. **ClusterIP (default)** – Exposes the service internally within the cluster.\n",
    "2. **NodePort** – Exposes the service on each Node’s IP at a static port.\n",
    "3. **LoadBalancer** – Integrates with cloud providers to create an external Load Balancer.\n",
    "4. **ExternalName** – Maps a Service to an external DNS name.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use Cases**\n",
    "- **ClusterIP**: Communication between microservices.\n",
    "- **NodePort**: Exposing a service externally when running Kubernetes on bare metal.\n",
    "- **LoadBalancer**: Exposing applications to the internet in cloud environments.\n",
    "- **ExternalName**: Redirecting traffic to external services (e.g., connecting to a managed database).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Deployments**\n",
    "#### **What is a Deployment?**\n",
    "- A **Deployment** is a higher-level controller that manages Pods.\n",
    "- It ensures the desired number of Pods are running and updates them when needed.\n",
    "- Deployments use **ReplicaSets** to maintain Pod availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How Deployments Work**\n",
    "- Define the number of Pod replicas to maintain.\n",
    "- Kubernetes automatically replaces failed Pods.\n",
    "- Supports **rolling updates and rollbacks**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use Cases**\n",
    "- Managing stateless applications.\n",
    "- Updating applications without downtime.\n",
    "- Scaling applications dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. ConfigMaps & Secrets**\n",
    "#### **What are ConfigMaps & Secrets?**\n",
    "- **ConfigMaps** store non-sensitive configuration data (e.g., environment variables, file paths).\n",
    "- **Secrets** store sensitive data (e.g., API keys, passwords) in a **base64-encoded** format.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use Cases**\n",
    "- Separating configuration from application code.\n",
    "- Storing credentials securely.\n",
    "- Mounting configurations as environment variables or volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Ingress**\n",
    "#### **What is an Ingress?**\n",
    "- **Ingress** is an API object that manages external access to Services, typically via HTTP/HTTPS.\n",
    "- It allows **host-based and path-based routing**.\n",
    "- Requires an **Ingress Controller** (e.g., NGINX Ingress Controller, Traefik).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use Cases**\n",
    "- Exposing multiple services under a single domain.\n",
    "- Enforcing SSL/TLS termination.\n",
    "- Load balancing HTTP traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. StatefulSets vs Deployments**\n",
    "| Feature          | Deployment  | StatefulSet  |\n",
    "|----------------|-------------|-------------|\n",
    "| Pod Identity   | No stable identity | Each Pod has a stable identity |\n",
    "| Use Case      | Stateless apps (e.g., web servers) | Stateful apps (e.g., databases) |\n",
    "| Storage       | Ephemeral | Uses persistent storage (PVC) |\n",
    "| Scaling       | Any order | Ordered scaling |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **When to Use StatefulSets?**\n",
    "- Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Cassandra, etc.).\n",
    "- Applications requiring stable network identities.\n",
    "- Apps that need ordered pod creation & deletion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Persistent Volumes (PV) & Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)**\n",
    "#### **What are PV & PVC?**\n",
    "- **Persistent Volume (PV)**: A storage resource in Kubernetes that outlives Pods.\n",
    "- **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**: A request for storage by a Pod.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use Cases**\n",
    "- Storing application data persistently.\n",
    "- Mounting storage across multiple Pods.\n",
    "- Preventing data loss when Pods restart.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8. Helm**\n",
    "#### **What is Helm?**\n",
    "- **Helm** is a package manager for Kubernetes.\n",
    "- Uses **Helm charts** to define, install, and manage Kubernetes applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use Cases**\n",
    "- Automating Kubernetes deployments.\n",
    "- Managing application configurations.\n",
    "- Deploying complex apps with dependencies (e.g., databases, monitoring tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **9. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**\n",
    "#### **What is RBAC?**\n",
    "- **RBAC** controls **who can do what** in a Kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "- Uses **Roles & RoleBindings** (for a namespace) and **ClusterRoles & ClusterRoleBindings** (for the whole cluster).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use Cases**\n",
    "- Restricting access to critical resources.\n",
    "- Managing permissions for developers & admins.\n",
    "- Implementing security best practices.\n",

    "## **Kubernetes Architecture**  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **Cluster** contains **Nodes**.  \n",
    "2. There are two types of **Nodes**: **Master (Control Plane) Nodes** and **Worker Nodes**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Worker Nodes**  \n",
    "Each worker node contains:  \n",
    "   - **Container Runtime** (e.g., Docker, containerd) → Responsible for running containers.  \n",
    "   - **Kubelet** → Interacts with both the node and the pods, ensuring they are running as expected. It communicates with the control plane.  \n",
    "   - **Kube-Proxy** → Manages networking for the node, enabling communication between services.  \n",
    "   - **Pods** → The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Master (Control Plane) Node**  \n",
    "Responsible for managing the cluster and making scheduling decisions. It contains:  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - **API Server** → The entry point for all interactions with Kubernetes. It handles requests from the CLI (`kubectl`) and UI (Dashboard, Lens, etc.).  \n",
    "   - **Scheduler** → Decides on which worker node a new pod should be scheduled based on available resources. Once scheduled, the **Kubelet** on that node will start the pod.  \n",
    "   - **Controller Manager** → Detects state changes (e.g., if a pod crashes, it ensures a new one is scheduled). It manages different controllers (Node Controller, Deployment Controller, etc.).  \n",
    "   - **etcd** → A distributed key-value store that acts as Kubernetes' **single source of truth**. It stores all cluster data, including node resources and pod states.  \n",
    "     - **Note:** etcd does **not** store application data (e.g., if a SQL database is running in a pod, etcd will not store the database’s data).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pods, ReplicaSets, and Deployments**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pod**:  \n",
    "  - The **smallest deployable unit** in Kubernetes.  \n",
    "  - Contains **one or more containers** that share the same storage and network.  \n",
    "  - **Pods are ephemeral** (if a pod crashes, it's lost unless managed by a higher-level controller).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **ReplicaSet**:  \n",
    "  - Ensures that a specified number of **replicas** (copies) of a pod are running at all times.  \n",
    "  - If a pod crashes, the **ReplicaSet** will create a new one automatically.  \n",
    "  - **However, ReplicaSets are rarely used directly**—they are managed by Deployments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deployment**:  \n",
    "  - The most common way to manage applications in Kubernetes.  \n",
    "  - Ensures that a **desired number of replicas** of a pod are running and allows updates to be rolled out gradually.  \n",
    "  - When you update a Deployment (e.g., changing an app version), Kubernetes will **create a new ReplicaSet** and gradually replace the old pods.  \n",
    "  - Supports **rollback** in case of failures.  \n",
